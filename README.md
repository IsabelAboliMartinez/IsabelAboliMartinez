- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IsabelAboliMartinez, about my:

Hello, I am normally a very positive and optimistic person.
I am doing development training and at the moment Git in general is being a real nightmare for me.
I am aware of how useful and necessary it is for my development in the professional field and I believe I understand at least the general concept, but putting it into practice is being a complex process.
I respect and commit to this community to use it in a useful and responsible way, but I'm barely like a baby, and my movements are somewhat unstable.
